In this project, I conducted an analysis of a PDF file to extract hidden data and uncover useful information. To achieve this, I used Linux command-line tools but encountered certain limitations due to the lack of an internet connection on the virtual machine. First, I checked the contents of the current directory by running ls and found the file Repdf.pdf. I attempted to open it using xdg-open Repdf.pdf, but the system returned an error: (atril:1993): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: 22:35:59.841: invalid uninstantiatable type '(null)' in cast to 'EvMediaPlayerKeys', which meant that the document could not be opened with standard tools. I then decided to check whether the file contained any hidden text data by using strings Repdf.pdf | less, but the process froze, and rerunning the command also yielded no results. Next, I decided to check if the PDF contained any hidden images and used the pdfimages -png Repdf.pdf ext utility. After executing this command, the following files appeared in the directory: ext-000.png, ext-001.png, ext-002.png, indicating that the images had been successfully extracted from the PDF. I then tried to open the extracted images using feh ext-000.png, but I received a message stating that the feh command was not found and could be installed via sudo apt install feh. I then tried the display ext-000.png command but encountered another error: Command 'display' not found, but can be installed with: sudo apt install imagemagick. I decided to install feh, first updating the package list with sudo apt update && sudo apt install feh -y, but the installation process froze at 0% [Connecting to eu-west-1.ec2.archive.ubuntu.com], confirming the lack of an internet connection on the virtual machine. Realizing that installing the required utilities was not an option, I decided to use an alternative method and opened the PDF file in LibreOffice Draw. Inside the file, I found an image with a warning sign ("Caution Image"). I moved it aside and discovered a QR code underneath. After scanning it with an online scanner, I successfully obtained the flag!
